# DUPRE: Data Utility Prediction for Efficient Data Valuation
This repository contains the official implementation of DUPRE, a framework designed to efficiently compute data valuations (e.g., Shapley values) by predicting coalition utilities with a Gaussian Process (GP) model. DUPRE supports any cooperative game–based data valuation (Shapley, Banzhaf, etc.) while reducing the need for expensive model retraining.

The framework display as following:
